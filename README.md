# python-challenge
This is a repo for the Python homework.


Development notes below:
- Created the Analysis and Resources directories and then added the CSV files to the Resources directories for the respective exercises.
- Adding these to git took three tries because of the large CSV files.  
- PyBank:
  - added opening and reading of CSV file... had a minor syntax error, but otherwise it was Chocolate Cake!
  - added iteration through the CSV file and initial calculations for total months, net profits/losses over 
  entire period, greatest increase in profit (date and amount) over entire period, greatest decrease in
  losses (date and amount) over entire period (assuming that this means the greatest loss, because
  "greatest decrease in losses" could mean something else entirely)
  - I am not sure what "calculate the changes in profit/losses over the entire period, then find the average of those changes" means, 
  so I am going to punt for the moment with my best guess, then ask in class on Thursday (no Tuesday class this week)
